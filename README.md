# Cricket-Score-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

The project focusses on predicting the most accurate score that a team may score given various factors like the venue, current batsman, bowler, etc. There are 3 datasets containg details of ipl, odi and t20 matches. A suitable data visualization has been done for the same datasets. For this predictive model Linear Regression, Decision
Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression have been used and a comparison has been presented based on the accuracy of the score predicted.
